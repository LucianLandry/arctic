## How to contribute

(... wait, really?? ... Okay!)

I am interested in hearing about (and fixing) any shouldn't-happen failures (crashes, interface protocol conformance issues, engine makes illegal move or loses on time, etc.)  Depending on the issue, I might ask for a backtrace, logs, etc.  If the issue cannot be resolved with the information at hand, I will probably close it until more info can be provided.

At this time, enhancement requests are more "hmmm".  Some things (ex. "let's rewrite everything to use magic bitboards") don't fit with my goals at this time.  For others (ex. opening books) I have some certain approaches I'd like to take and/or they are lower priority.  For yet others (ex. GUI) I'd like to write an initial approach myself just to become more proficient at it.  That said, I don't want to be a total curmudgeon and I am interested in feedback.

If you have general feedback, mail me at "lucian_b_landry AT yahoo D0T com" and be sure to include "arctic" in your Subject: line.

Otherwise, submit an issue to the github Issue Tracker, and we'll figure it out.  Some issues may be addressed, and some may linger (for a long time, even) but my goal is to at least respond to all of them.

Thanks! --buck
