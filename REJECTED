movgen coroutine discarded, slightly slower (version 0.7).

try lva quiescent move ordering. (seemed not a win or lose; code slightly
	more complex) (version 0.9)

partial hashhit, slowed code down by 2% and -- with our coarse evaluations
	only came into play about .0002% (extreme max) of the time.  Could
	possibly be tried later.

bitboard nopose.  no effect (unless made inline, where it actually slowed
	things down.)  Probably due to being on 32-bit platform and cache hit.
