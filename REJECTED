sort moves based on last eval? (not even worth trying, probably too compute-intensize ... well, maybe at higher levels of search.)

try any hashed move first... maybe even before normal movgen.  ... discarded,
	slightly slower. (version 9)

movgen coroutine discarded, slightly slower (version 7).

try lva quiescent move ordering. (seemed not a win or lose; code slightly
	more complex) (version 9)

partial hashhit, slowed code down by 2% and -- with our coarse evaluations
	only came into play about .0002% (extreme max) of the time.  Could
	possibly be tried later.

bitboard nopose.  no effect (unless made inline, where it actually slowed
	things down.)  Probably due to being on 32-bit platform and cache hit.
