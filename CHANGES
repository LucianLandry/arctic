Out-there (maybe, maybe not)
Neural net evaluation.  Examples: neurochess, SAL, morph.
Still more efficient smp search (propagate alpha-beta up the pv?)
Go directly from pondering to thinking on a ponderhit, just like
	any good UCI engine would do.
Razoring variation?  Something like doing a depth-2 search to see which moves
	to only do a depth-1 search on.  If the search is good enough I could
	also use it for move ordering.
Adaptive back-propagating opening book?
Figure out some way to spot "obvious" (no decent alternative) moves and make
	them quickly.  Perhaps a full alpha-beta search to (lastSearchDepth -
	2) or something.  Might also want it to be in the PV.
pgn-format save/restore.
multiple-computer/clustering search.
    We will probably need to use a custom protocol for this.  The closest
    "standard" way to do what I want would be UCI, + alpha/beta constraint
    option to "go", plus a way to easily unmake/make moves on an internal board.
Find a way to advance the pawn in the endgame w/out it getting crowded out by
	other moves (this is less bad after I implemented PV)?  Do I give pawn
	rank a bonus?  Or make it a preferred move?
Support multiple kings on the board.  Also consider not hard-coding which
	pieces are 'royal' (ie killing them wins the game)
Support for chess variants.  fischer-random, crazyhouse and Die come to mind.
	Also consider the FICS wild variants + Xboard variants.
uiXboard: implement 'hint', analyze mode.
Fractional ply extension. (+ 1/numMoves)
Shrink search window (not null necessarily, but do shrink it)
Better thread utilization: keep all threads busy through end of minimax compute
	(including last move).
More search time if first move's eval goes down.  Finish the level. ... at
     least try to find a move that doesn't go down.  Especially if first move
     evals to -checkmate.

Version 1.2:

        pieces)
Refactored MoveList (and removed MLIST_MAX_MOVES limit) (7% slowdown).
Refactored Board and Position (~3% slowdown, but fixed a minor biasDraw issue).
Removed MAX_NUM_PROCS limitation (except for basic user input validation).
Refactored Clock API + made PerMoveTime() take total clock time into account.
Bugfix: we were jumping between 2 mating positions (because nothing better was
        in the transposition table) until the opponent could draw.
Refactored Eval(uations) into their own class, and made PV contain a true eval.

Implement UCI interface.

Version 0.9:
alpha-search -> alpha-beta search (oops)
hashing: -- Use highbound/lowbound instead of eval+alpha.

Prettier PV (Na3 instead of b1a3, etc.)
Time display accurate to (some) hundredths of a sec.
Move immediately if we found a mate.
